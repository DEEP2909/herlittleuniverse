<h1>A Letter From Panda 🐼</h1>
<p>
My Gudiya,<br><br>

Every day I thank life for giving me you.  
You are not just my love — you are my comfort, my smile, my peace, and my chaos in the most beautiful way.

Distance may keep our hands apart, but it will never separate our hearts.

On your birthday, I don’t just wish you happiness…  
I promise to be part of it.

Forever yours,  
Panda 💖
